 - how are nulls handled in bq order by and group by?
	- in bq order by nulls are considered the least possible values, so in ascending they appear first and in descending they appear last
	- they are considered less than negatives
- NaN is a term used to represent a value that is undefined or unrepresentable
	- floating point
	- we get it usually when we try to perform an operation that is mathematically not defined
		- for example ln -4, sqrt(-2) but not 1/0 this gives inf
	- aka Not a number
	- [math - What is NaN (Not a Number) in the words of a beginner? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59335027/what-is-nan-not-a-number-in-the-words-of-a-beginner)
- where as null is used to indicate absence of value or missing value
- null is considered less than NaN
	- -inf greater than NaN and null in bq
- division by 0 is not possible in bq
	- I manually tested it
- grouping on columns with nulls considers null to be part of one group or in other words groups the nulls together
- but when we try an equi join on columns with nulls, the rows with nulls are not returned
