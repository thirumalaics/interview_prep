- limit is a booby trap
	- speeds up performance by does not reduce cost
	- limi puts a cap on the output rows, we need to move around less data on BQ nw
- Select few columns
- use exists instead of count
- use approx agg fns
- replace self join with window fn
- order by or join on int 64 columns
- optimize anti joins
- trim data early and often
- WHERE sequence matters
- utilize partitions and clusters
- push order by to the end of query
- relay resource intensive operations
- use SEARCH
- take adv of caching
