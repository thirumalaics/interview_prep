- explain architecture of bq
	- dremel is used as the query processing engine, which compiles our queries into execution trees
	- Colossus is a cluster based storage system that stores data as column based files
	- There is jupiter which is the Google pb network which helps decoupling of compute and storage
	- borg is the job scheduler and resource manager. spins up resources as needed
- difference between legacy and std sql in bq
	- the above two are two dialects supported by BQ and have different syntax, semantics and functions
	- in the past, BQ used to execute queries using a non-std sql dialect called BQ SQL
	- since BQ 2.0, the service now supports std SQL while the previous BQ SQL was renamed to Legacy SQL
	- Std SQL is an ANSI compliant query language
	- legacy sql is still maintained mostly for backward compatibility purposes
		- some point in the future, legacy SQL will be deprecated
	- DDL and DML are only supported by STD SQL
	- every type in legacy sql has an equivalent in std sql and vice versa
		- types in each dialect has a different name
	- in legacy, colon was used as a separator when referencing a project name whilst std dialect requires a period 
	- table names with common prefix are referenced differently in both dialects
		- std sql does it via wildcard tables
	- instead of \`, \[ was used
- time travel:
	- `SELECT * from t for SYSTEM TIME AS Of TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);`
- try dedup in bq
