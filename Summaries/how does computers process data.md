- CPU
	- has a clock
		- For every ticket oF the clock, our CPU goes through one step in what's called a Fetch-decode-execute cycle
	- 3 registers
		- bits oF Fast storage where the CPU holds values that it's working on right now
			- program counter - keeps track oF our instruction cycle
			- instruction register - loads instruction Frrom memory and holds it For decoding
			- accumulator
	- fetch-decode-execute cycle repeated on a loop
- memory is a place to have our instructions and store the values that we calculate
	- RAM
![[Pasted image 20240706180039.png]]- memory holds instruction and instruction has 2 parts
	- the actual instruction itself and usually a memory address
