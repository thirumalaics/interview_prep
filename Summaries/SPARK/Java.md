## What are the memory types in JVM?
- heap memory
	- Objects, created by the app, are allocated on the JVM heap and bound by GC
	- discussed above as well
- stack memory
	- JV stores local variables and method information
	- used for thread execution as well
	- in an application, each thread has its own stack that stores information about the methods and variables it's currently using
	- fixed size determined by the jvm at runtime
	- StackOverflowError
	- used to store temp vars or primitive data types in Java
